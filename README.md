This project implements a cellular automata simulator.

Names: Edison Ooi, Haris Adnan, Matt Knox


### Timeline

Start Date: January 23, 2022

Finish Date: February 6, 2022

Hours Spent: 50

### Primary Roles
* Matt: Implementing specific simulation algorithms and tracking the state of
the simulation, both on model and view side.
* Edison: Designing and parsing configuration files, exception handling, writing 
abstraction for simulation types, general UI architecture
* Haris: Visualization components such as main GUI with user controls, displaying
multiple windows simultaneously, and styling using properties files.


### Resources Used


### Running the Program

Main class:

Data files needed: 
* Simulation configuration files located in data/simulation_configs
* SimulationValues.properties in src/main/resources/view
* One properties file per simulation type in src/main/resources/view

Features implemented:



### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications:

Interesting data files:

Known Bugs:
* The GridView does not fit perfectly into the given screen. 

Noteworthy Features: 
* Cell configurations can be generated from the XML using a given configuration,
randomly, or from given probabilities for each state.
* Neighborhoods can be specified in the configuration file as any combination of
neighbors and non-neighbors around a reference cell
